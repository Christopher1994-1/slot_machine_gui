A simple slot machine game that I enjoyed putting together.

Here is the start of the program and the default wheel layout is the triple 7s.

When a user tries to press the spin button, the spin button enables disabled state and a new label comes onto the screen prompting the user to add funds in order to play.

When the user presses the deposit button a new window pops up that will allow the user to enter in a vaild balance amount. If the user enters in letters instead of numbers 
a new label will pop up prompting the user to only enter numbers. Then once that is done the window will close and the vaild balance amount will be added.

After a few spins the user might hit the unlucky row of the 'busted' card which will prompt a new label at the bottom telling the user that they have lost. When this
row happens 50 points will be deducted from the users total balance.

The triple 7s is the best outcome the user can hope for and again when this row is hit a new label at the bottom will let the user know they have won and will
add 1000 points to thei total balance. 

Obviously slot machines are far more complex than this but this is a good starting point.
